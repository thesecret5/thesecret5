	<p>In the future, diagnostic devices will be able to monitor a patient’s physiological or biochemical parameters continuously, under natural physiological conditions and in any environment through wearable biomedical sensors. Together with apps that capture and interpret data, and integrated enterprise and cloud data repositories, the networks of wearable devices and body area networks will constitute the healthcare’s Internet of Things. In this review, four main areas of interest in respiratory healthcare are described: pulse oximetry, pulmonary ventilation, activity tracking, and air quality assessment. Although several issues still need to be solved, smart wearable technologies will provide unique opportunities for the future or personalized respiratory medicine.

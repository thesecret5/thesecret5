	<h2>Technology is changing how we engage audiences</h2>
	<img src="images/arms.jpeg"width="430"height="420">
	<p>New technology is emerging at lightning speed. As industry and consumers become accustomed to these advancements, it’s beginning to impact the way brands are doing business and communicating to their customers. In 2018, there will be innovative ways in which companies are capitalizing on technology to create meaningful experiences. Experiences being the operative word. Technology should not be used just for the sake of incorporating the latest shiny object into a campaign. The goal is to create the most memorable experience that fully reflects a brand and its message, using technology as a vehicle for the overall consumer journey. That is when true success will emerge and engagement will yield the greatest results. </p>

	<p>When people need physical therapy after an injury, they typically take days off work to go to physiotherapy clinics for multiple treatments. Those treatments can be expensive if the therapy isn’t covered by insurance, and time lag between appointments can be frustrating in terms of lost time and slower healing.

But an emerging trend in medicine is to take treatment out of the clinic and make it mobile.</p>

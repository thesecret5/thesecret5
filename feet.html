	<h2>The Future of Footwear</h2>
	<img src="jpeg 3.jpg" alt="smart Shoes" width="420"height="420">
	<p>From sneakers that signal directions with vibrations to socks that help athletes prevent injuries, our feet are poised to become the next logical place to embed wearable technology.</p>
	
	<h2>Smart Shoes</h2>
	<img src="jpeg 5.jpg" alt="Heated Insoles" width="430"height="420">
	<p>Yes, you will soon be able to own a pair of shoes that can keep your feet toasty. French startup Digitisole started with heated insoles and has now gone the full works building its heated tech into a smart shoe.

Set to be available in three designs, the most eye-grabbing pair look like they've stepped out of a Back to the Future movie and has a self-lacing inspired feature automatically tightening around the ankle to keep them snug and secure.

Using a heat pad and rechargeable battery inside the shoe, the heat pad transforms energy from the battery into heat to generate the warmth. The temperature is controlled from the Digitsole app on your smartphone, while a built-in thermostat should ensure it's doesn't get too hot in there.</p>
